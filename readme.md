### Abstract

This study examines the effectiveness of X’s Community Notes as a community-driven intervention against misinformation during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Quantitative analysis of 38.5 million election-related posts and 13,745 Community Notes, identified both strengths and limitations in the program’s implementation. The median publication time of 8.7 hours was relatively prompt, though with extreme variability (SD 158.7). Quantile regression revealed that time-to-publication varied systematically by observable factors: some logically (posts classified as misinformation published faster) while others appeared counterproductive (rater agreement on lower-quality notes associated with shorter publication times than those with reliable sources). 

Rater participation emerged as one of the strongest factors affecting publication speed, aligning with the platform’s acknowledged challenges of data sparsity and resulting score instability. However, overall program coverage remained minimal, with only 0.014% of posts receiving Notes and just 4% of submitted Notes ever reaching publication status. These findings suggest systemic constraints significantly limit the potential effectiveness of community-driven interventions at platform scale, particularly during critical periods such as elections.
